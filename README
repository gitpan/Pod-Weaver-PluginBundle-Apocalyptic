NAME
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic - Let the apocalypse generate
    your POD!

VERSION
      This document describes v0.001 of Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::Apocalyptic - released March 05, 2011 as part of Pod-Weaver-PluginBundle-Apocalyptic.

DESCRIPTION
    In your weaver.ini:

            [@Apocalyptic]

    Or alternatively, in your Dist::Zilla dist's dist.ini:

            [PodWeaver]
            config_plugin = @Apocalyptic

    This plugin bundle formats your POD and adds some sections and sets some
    custom options. Naturally, in order for most of the plugins to work, you
    need to use this in conjunction with Dist::Zilla.

    It is nearly equivalent to the following in your weaver.ini:

            [@CorePrep]                     ; setup the pod stuff
            [-Encoding]                     ; add the =encoding command to your POD via Pod::Weaver::Plugin::Encoding
            encoding = utf-8
            [Region / Pod::Coverage]        ; move any Pod::Coverage markers to the top ( =for Pod::Coverage foo bar )
            [StopWords]                     ; gather our stopwords and add some extra ones via Pod::Weaver::Section::StopWords

            [Name]                          ; automatically generate the NAME section
            [Version]                       ; automatically generate the VERSION section
            format = This document describes v%v of %m - released %{LLLL dd, yyyy}d as part of %r.
            is_verbatim = 1

            [Generic / SYNOPSIS]            ; move the SYNOPSIS section here, if it exists
            [Generic / DESCRIPTION]         ; move the DESCRIPTION section here ( it is required to exist! )
            required = 1

            [Collect / ATTRIBUTES]          ; get any POD marked as =attr and list them here
            command = attr
            [Collect / METHODS]             ; get any POD marked as =method and list them here
            command = method
            [Collect / FUNCTIONS]           ; get any POD marked as =func and list them here
            command = func

            [Leftovers]                     ; any other POD you use

            [SeeAlso]                       ; generate the SEE ALSO section via Pod::Weaver::Section::SeeAlso
            [Support]                       ; generate the SUPPORT section via Pod::Weaver::Section::Support ( only present in main module )
            irc = irc.perl.org, #perl-help, Apocalypse
            irc = irc.freenode.net, #perl, Apocal
            irc = irc.efnet.org, #perl, Ap0cal
            email = APOCAL
            [Authors]                       ; automatically generate the AUTHOR(S) section
            [Generic / ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS]    ; move the ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS section here, if it exists
            [Legal]                         ; automatically generate the COPYRIGHT AND LICENSE section
            [WarrantyDisclaimer]            ; automatically generate the DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY section via Pod::Weaver::Section::WarrantyDisclaimer

            [-Transformer]
            transformer = List              ; mangle all :list pod into proper lists via Pod::Elemental::Transformer::List
            [-EnsureUniqueSections]         ; sanity check your sections to make sure they are unique via Pod::Weaver::Plugin::EnsureUniqueSections

    If you need something to be configurable ( probably the Support section,
    ha! ) please let me know and I can add it in a future version.
